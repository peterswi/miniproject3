                    <h3> <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings">The Washington Post Police Shootings data</a> provided interesting insights we got to explore in our second Mini Project, and we wanted to continue working with this data in our third Mini Project. 
                        One of our goals for Mini Project 3 was to show an aspect of the data we had not previously shown -- such as weapons in possession of the victim. 
                        We were particularly interested in looking at the racial breakdown of weapon possession. This was a topic that we did not explore heavily in our second Mini Project, 
                        but we had explored the relationship between race and frequency of victims. Our hypothesis was that there would exist differences in what weapons the victims did or did not have on themselves by race, and our interactive visualizations would serve to confirm or disprove this hypothesis.
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        To illustrate the significance of race in the discussion surrounding police shootings, 
                        we opted for a bar graph to show the distribution of victims by racial group, 
                        and a pie chart to illustrate the breakdown of the weaponry on victims. 
                        When not hovering over the bar of a particular racial group, the pie chart shows the breakdown 
                        for all victims in general. When a user hovers over a particular bar in the chart, 
                        however, the pie chart adjusts to illustrate the breakdown of weapons on victims belonging to a certain racial group. 
                        We thought that this would be impactful because users can see the pie chart auto-adjust according to a racial group; 
                        it will be easier to see when wedges get larger or smaller, especially with a smooth transition.

                        <br>
                        As a result of our visualization, we were able to make some interesting insights. Overall, there was not a huge amount of variation across races in the weapon that a victim did or did not have on them at the time of death. However, there were a couple of interesting differences that we noticed. First, Black and white victims had guns on them at similar rates, yet Black victims were more likely to be unarmed at the time of their death than where white victims. After doing Mini Project 2 and seeing that Black people are killed at disproportionate rates, we took note of this difference in arming. Additionally, our visualization also showed that Hispanic, Asian, and Native American victims were less likely to have guns on them than the rate of all victims, with Asian victims being the least likely to have a gun. Overall, the rate of those who were unarmed or had a toy weapon on them was fairly consistent, with Black victims being unarmed the most frequently of any racial group.

                <div class = 'content'>
                    <h3> When we first began brainstorming interactive components of this project, we planned to center the visualizations around our “Breakdown of Fatalities” bar chart. This bar chart shows the percent of total fatalities broken down by race. We imagined that we would have a couple different charts that would interact with this chart when the user moused over it. The first idea we had was for a pie chart to appear under the graph, showing the weapon the victim possessed at the time of their death. If the user moused over the white bar, they would see the breakdown for white victims specifically, for example. We also planned to include another bar chart showing the gender breakdown of victims. We imagined that if the viewer moused over a certain race, they could see the gender breakdown of victims of that race. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    Those were our ideas we presented in the first deliverable, but they have changed since then. One major change was getting rid of the gender breakdown bar chart. We made this decision for a few different reasons. Kathryn took the lead on the gender bar chart and realized quickly that they did not provide any major insight. The breakdown is similar to what one may expect -- women only made up a tiny proportion of those killed by police. There were also no major differences amongst the races. With how much work it would take to produce a stacked bar chart with d3, our team decided to not include the gender bar chart in our final deliverable. We also realized it would take more time to connect our original bar chart with the pie chart. So Erin finished development on the race bar chart and our team moved forward.

                        <br>
                    Now that we were able to focus our efforts on the pie chart, Lurein and Will spent time setting this up.

                <h1> Challenges & Takeaways</h1>
                <div class = 'content'>
                    <h3> Our first challenge, surprisingly, came from a great interest in the data. Because we are all so interested in our dataset, we struggled to narrow down what visualizations we wanted to make and how they would interact. This meant that we spent a few sessions brainstorming and in early development, and did not narrow down our goal for the final deliverable until closer to the deadline. As mentioned previously, we pursued creating a stacked bar chart for gender, but ultimately decided that it did not provide much insight and chose not to include it in our final deliverable. However, we still lost some time due to our indecision. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    Another challenge that we faced was learning as we went. Lab 6 was the first time that any of us had been exposed to interactive visualizations using d3, and we found it challenging to split up work between the Lab and Mini Project. Ultimately, we chose to break up our project into two parts: first, focus on developing the static visualizations, and then move on to the interactions. We implemented the interactivity after completing Lab 6, and this was helpful as the lab served as practice for our mini project. We understood the foundation of implementing interactivity, and could jump right in rather than spend a lot of our time researching. The one drawback of this was that it took us closer to the deadline, but because we had successful static visualizations already, the implementation was manageable within the given window. Additionally, we are excellent communicators and conduct frequent meetings to ensure that we are making progress as both individuals and as a group toward our final deliverables.
